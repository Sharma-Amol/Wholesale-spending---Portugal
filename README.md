# Wholesale spending - Portugal

## Code
[DBSCAN](https://github.com/Sharma-Amol/Wholesale-spending---Portugal/blob/main/Portfolio%20Project%20-%20Hierarchal%20Clustering%20and%20DBSCAN%20Final.ipynb)

## Context
The data set refers to clients of a wholesale distributor from Portugal. It includes the annual spending in monetary units (m.u.) on diverse product categories like milk, frozen, detergents, delicatessen, etc.

Unsupervised learning projects are more open ended. In this particular project, I wanted to discover clusters, if any, and identify outliers in the data. What features are pushing them to be outliers?

This exercise and the associated dataset were provided as part of the excellent course 'Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass' by Jose Portilla on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/), which I successfully completed.
